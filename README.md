### Usage
----------------------------------
Use a Font Awesome icon in any view:
```swift
import SwiftUI
import FASwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        FAText(iconName: "bomb", size: 200)
    }
}
```

You can also choose an alternate style.
(This is ignored if the icon is a brand and currently duotone is not supported and will default back to regular.)

```swift
import SwiftUI
import FASwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        FAText(iconName: "bomb", size: 200, style: .solid)
    }
}
```

Set the color as you would any text.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import FASwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        FAText(iconName: "bomb", size: 200)
            .foregroundColor(Color.red)
    }
}
```

Have the user select an icon with an easy string binding (not available on macOS)

```swift
import SwiftUI
import FASwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    
    @State var selectedIcon: String?
    @State var showingPicker: Bool = false
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            FAText(iconName: selectedIcon ?? "question-square", size: 200)
            Button(action: {
                self.showingPicker = true
            }) {
                Text("Choose icon")
            }
        }
        .sheet(isPresented: $showingPicker) {
            FAPicker(showing: self.$showingPicker, selected: self.$selectedIcon)
        }
    }
}
```
